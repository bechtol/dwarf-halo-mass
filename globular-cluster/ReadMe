Abundance and kinematics of dwarfs to estimate halo mass of dwarfs.  Can it work? 

1. Is it possible to use the abundance and kinematics of globulars to measure halo masses?  Multiple considerations:
  (a)how many globulars are there as a function of halo mass?
  (b)what is the total stellar mass in globulars as a function of host mass?
  (c)how concentrated is the distribution in the halo?
 
2. Additional considerations:
  (a)how many globulars will LSST find for a given type of galaxy, and out to what distance?
  (b)is spectrscopic follow-up possible?
  
1(a) and 1(b) are coupled, tied together by globular cluster mass function.  The shape of the globular cluster mass function (normed) is not a strong function of halo mass, a fact which has meant that it gets used as a distance indicator (https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept13/Kissler/Kissler7.html#7.1).

  -Mild trend with halo mass: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...836...67H (Harris et al. 2017).

  The ratio of the total stellar mass in globulars to halo mass is 4x10-5 with 0.2 dex scatter
  -Harris et al: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...836...67H
  Amplifies previous paper result, although with a slightly lower ratio of GC stellar mass to halo mass.
  -Mike B-K paper: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.472.3120B see section 5.
  So: maybe? we can get a noisy-ish measurement of LMC-mass halos.  It will be hard to push down, will be at the <N> ~ 1 limit below.
