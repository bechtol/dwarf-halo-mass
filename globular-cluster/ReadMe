Abundance and kinematics of dwarfs to estimate halo mass of dwarfs.  Can it work? 

1. Is it possible to use the abundance and kinematics of globulars to measure halo masses?  Multiple considerations:
  (a)how many globulars are there as a function of halo mass?
  (b)what is the total stellar mass in globulars as a function of host mass?
  (c)how concentrated is the distribution in the halo?
 
2. Additional considerations:
  (a)how many globulars will LSST find for a given type of galaxy, and out to what distance?
  (b)is spectrscopic follow-up possible?
  
1(a) and 1(b) are coupled, tied together by globular cluster mass function.  According to inside sources (Jay Strader), the globular cluster mass function (normed) is not a strong function of halo mass.

  -have not found a good ref or reproduced it myself (Annika) from other data.

  -Hudson et al: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/787/1/L5/pdf
  The ratio of the total stellar mass in globulars to halo mass is 4x10-5 with 0.2 dex scatter
  -Mike B-K paper: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.472.3120B see section 5.
  So: maybe? we can get a noisy-ish measurement of LMC-mass halos.  It will be hard to push down, will be at the <N> ~ 1 limit below.
