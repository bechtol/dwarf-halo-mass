Ideas for measuring halo masses of dwarfs.
1. Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing (Rachel is making forecasts w/support from Yao).
  a. Use the two-point function to remove high-z contaminants?
2. Globular cluster counts (stacked).
3. Globular/satellite kinematics (stacked).
4. CGM kinematics?
5. Galaxy stellar mass function (abundance matching; can/should be used in combination with 1)
  a. Low-ish redshift.
  b. Local Group (low stats but can get down to really tiny stellar masses).


Some thoughts about benchmarks:
  1. LMC mass (2x10^9 Msun in stellar mass): starts to be the place where "Too Big To Fail In The Field" problem arises; we think that the galaxy stellar mass function is probably reliable already for masses larger than this.  Can calibrate masses with several methods, plays a critical role in being able to push mass estimation techniques to lower masses.
  2. Fornax mass (2x10^7 Msun in stellar mass): where "Too Big To Fail" arises; galaxy stellar mass functions probably subject to significant surface brightness completeness issues today (lots of the new UDGs are sort of in this range), and definitely for lower stellar masses.
  3. Ultrafaints (<10^5 Msun):  Starting to get satellite luminosity functions on these scales for nearby galaxies; low surface brightness a challege for existing searches; holy grail for DM science; searches are going to be very local.
