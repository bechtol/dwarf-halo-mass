Ideas for measuring halo masses of dwarfs.
1. Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing (Rachel is making forecasts w/support from Yao).
  a. Use the two-point function to remove high-z contaminants?
2. Globular cluster counts (stacked).
3. Globular/satellite kinematics (stacked).
4. CGM kinematics?
5. Galaxy stellar mass function (abundance matching; can/should be used in combination with 1)
  a. Low-ish redshift.
  b. Local Group (low stats but can get down to really tiny stellar masses).
